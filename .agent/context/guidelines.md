# Product Guidelines

## Documentation & Messaging
- **Technical and Precise:** Documentation should prioritize technical accuracy and provide detailed specifications. Language should be formal and clear, targeting a developer-centric audience while remaining accessible for integration purposes.

## Error Handling & Feedback
- **Structured and Actionable:** Errors must be categorized with specific error codes and include actionable suggestions for resolution. The goal is to minimize developer friction and allow users to self-correct configuration or data issues.

## Extensibility & Architecture
- **Modular and Pluggable:** The system should be designed to allow for easy extension. Developers should be able to plug in new renderers, data models, or processing logic without requiring modifications to the core engine. This ensures the project remains adaptable to diverse bibliographic needs.

## Visual Identity & Branding
- **Modern and Professional:** The project's interfaces (CLI, web-based tools) should reflect reliability and high performance. This is achieved through clean typography, a consistent professional color palette, and a focus on clarity and speed in user interactions.
