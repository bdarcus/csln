This is a Rust library that implements the [csl-next](https://github.com/bdarcus/csl-next) bibliography model.

It is not yet fully-aligned with that model, and I will likely adjust both.

Note also that both models are more place-holders than anything; there are still a lot of decisions to make on the modeling. 
But this is enough to build out the other functionality.

The `csln-schemas` binary will generate the input JSON schemas.
