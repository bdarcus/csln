  title: Chicago 17, author-date
  description: | 
    How simple can we make a Chicago author-date style? 

    The goal here is to add:

    1. configurable conditional logic without adding it to templates
    2. presets in key places
options:
  processing: author-date # preset for sorting, grouping, disambiguation
  # titles are unique in that their rendering is dependent, more so than other content, on their type
  # this is a very common pattern, where component titles (articles, chapters, etc) are quoted, but
  # titles otherwise render in italics
  titles:
    component: # chapter and article titles render the same
      quoted: true
    default:
      emph: true
  contributors:
    delimiter: ", "
    andAs: text,
    citation: short # preset
    bibliography: full-chicago # preset name formatting and role
  substitute:
    role: short # non-author roles need to be included in the bibliography, but formatted differently than otherwise
    items:
     # this is the default value, so not needed
      - editor
      - title
      - translator
  dates: long
  numbers:
    label: contextual # Chicago 15.47-8
citation: # this should allow presets; "citation-author-date-chicago"
  integral:
    # Doe (2020, 2021), Jones (2019) and Smtih (2021) argued X.
    author: # since we have author and substitution in the core, am less concerned about this
